# Temperature-Taker
# Arduino (MLX90614 sensor)
A replacement is required when considering the safety of the person measuring the temperature.We have put an  effort to make that person's work more easier. Measuring temperature using the device we have invented eliminates the chances of spreadage of the Covid-19  Virus. We are able to do it ourselves using the resources available in our University. Specially while considering the  economical state of our country, our product will be very handy for the people.
